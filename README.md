Check it out here: **[https://pappa-padda.github.io/](https://pappa-padda.github.io/)**

This repository hosts the source code for my personal portfolio and resume website, built with HTML and based on a template from [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/). It's designed to be fully responsive and easy to maintain.
